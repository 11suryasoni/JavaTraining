This Package Contains Java OOPS Implementations in Rest-Api Program, E-mail from java code as well as ZIP and UNZIP Programs. 

The codes for different applications like :
#
---> REST-API OOPS : The project contains programs that have Java OOPS Implementations.
    
    Most modern phone and web apps have a RESTful service in the background controlling all the underlying business logic: its the "brains"
    A basic RESTful server example: a shopping cart web service with endpoints (explicit interfaces) for adding an item to cart, listing 
    contents, deleting an item, checking out, etc. a RESTful web service runs over the standard http(s) web protocol like a web server
    But use http as an arbitrary interface: send arbitrary requests (not just requests for webpage html/css/images), return arbitrary results
    (not just html/css/etc). "REST" stands for something but think of the server "at rest" until a request comes in from the phone app or 
    browser JavaScript code. The key to a good RESTful protocol is a clear specification of the requests allowed and responses expected.

---> E-MAIL : Implementations of OOPS concepts in Pipe and Converters Program.
    
    Sending Email is a basic requirement regardless of which platform you are working on like JAVA, JavaEE, Python etc. Sending Email may be 
    required to send error alerts or confirmation of registration or signup. Java provides the facility to send emails by writing java programs.
    To send emails using Java, you need three things: 
    
    JavaMail API
    Java Activation Framework (JAF)
    Your SMTP server details

---> ZIP - UNZIP : This contains screenshots of chars program.
    
    To unzip a zip file, we need to read the zip file with ZipInputStream and then read all the ZipEntry one by one. Then use FileOutputStream
    to write them to file system. We also need to create the output directory if it doesn't exists and any nested directories present in the zip
    file
