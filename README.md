![logo](https://logicmojo.com/assets/dist/new_pages/images/oops-concepts-in-java.jpg)  - ![UnitTesting](http://java4development.weebly.com/uploads/2/8/8/5/28851303/2809222.png)

This Package Contains JUNIT Testing in java as well as Java OOPs Concepts Program Implementation. 

The codes for different applications like :
#
---> JUNIT TESTING : The project contains programs that uses Junit For Testing the methods using different testcases.
    
    JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development, 
    and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks which is collectively known as xUnit that originated with SUnit.
    JUnit is linked as a JAR at compile-time. - 

---> OOPS : Implementations of OOPS concepts in Pipe and Converters Program.
    
    Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the 
    form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A common feature of objects is that procedures are attached to them and can 
    access and modify the object's data fields.

---> CHARTS SCREENSHOTS : This contains screenshots of chars program.
    
    Image result for CHARTS A chart is a graphical representation for data visualization, in which "the data is represented by symbols, 
    such as bars in a bar chart, lines in a line chart, or slices in a pie chart". A chart can represent tabular numeric data, functions 
    or some kinds of quality structure and provides different info.
