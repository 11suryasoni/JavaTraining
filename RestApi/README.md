# REST-API , CHARTS & CONVERTERS

![logo](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/qqqqqqq-1-1024x219.jpeg)

This Package Contains REST API JAVA Implementations, CHARTS AND CONVERTERS Programs. 

The codes for different applications like :
#
---> REST-API OOPS : The project contains programs that have Java OOPS Implementations.
    
    Most modern phone and web apps have a RESTful service in the background controlling all the underlying business logic: its the "brains"
    A basic RESTful server example: a shopping cart web service with endpoints (explicit interfaces) for adding an item to cart, listing 
    contents, deleting an item, checking out, etc. a RESTful web service runs over the standard http(s) web protocol like a web server
    But use http as an arbitrary interface: send arbitrary requests (not just requests for webpage html/css/images), return arbitrary results
    (not just html/css/etc). "REST" stands for something but think of the server "at rest" until a request comes in from the phone app or 
    browser JavaScript code. The key to a good RESTful protocol is a clear specification of the requests allowed and responses expected.

---> REST-API - MUSEUM API : Implementations of OOPS concepts in Pipe and Converters Program.
    
    The Metropolitan Museum of Art presents over 5,000 years of art from around the world for everyone to experience and enjoy. The Museum 
    lives in two iconic sites in New York Cityâ€”The Met Fifth Avenue and The Met Cloisters. Millions of people also take part in The Met experience 
    online.
    
    At this time, we do not require API users to register or obtain an API key to use the service. Please limit request rate to 80 requests per 
    second.

    Endpoints :-

    There are API endpoints available for the following elements:

    Objects: A listing of all valid Object IDs available for access.
    Object: A record for an object, containing all open access data about that object, including its image (if the image is available under Open 
    Access)
    Departments: A listing of all valid departments, with their department ID and the department display name
    Search: A listing of all Object IDs for objects that contain the search query within the objectâ€™s data


---> REST-API - CRYPTO API  : This contains screenshots of chars program.
    
    Power your applications with CoinGeckoâ€™s independently sourced crypto data such as live prices, trading volume, exchange volumes, trading
    Pairs, historical data, contract address data, crypto categories, crypto derivatives, images and more.Our Free API* has a rate limit of 
    10-50 calls/minute, and doesn't require API key. Need something more powerful? 
    Subscribe to our paid API plans to access Pro API key! ðŸ”‘ For users with Pro API key , please use this root URL to make API request: 
    https://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/

---> REST-API - CHARTS  : This contains screenshots of chars program.
    
    With the Charts widgets, you can use data from a REST Service to plot graphs.

    This how-to will teach you how to do the following:-

    Publish a REST API
    Use a REST endpoint as a data source for the Charts widget


---> REST-API - CONVERTERS  : This contains screenshots of chars program.
    
    Generated Files from the above two API'S will be converted into one form to another.
    The different formats are :
    1- PDF
    2- HTML
    3- XML
